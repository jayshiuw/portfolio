  <p id="main">Hi, please allow me to introduce myself a little bit.<br /> I currently finished 1B term of mechanical engineering bachelor degree
     at University of Waterloo. That being said, I finished my first year mechanical engineering study and anticipated to enter
     second year study at 2017.  I have finished courses that 
     taught me to use AutoCAD,  SolidWork and C++. The details will be demonstrated in project page.
     <br /> Also, I am very self-initiative, 
     I self learned HTML and CSS during my spare time. So I build this website out of my self-learned HTML and CSS knowledge and some 
     online resources (I learned HTML and CSS from a book, and learned how to host a website from online resources). And I did not use 
     any website that already has templates that helps style and  edit your websites . <br />
     Despite that, my academic standing is also excellent. I got excellent academic standing in both 1A and 1B terms 
     I am planning to build a website that helps motivating people. I believe as I keep learning, I will build a more stylish and useful
     website.
