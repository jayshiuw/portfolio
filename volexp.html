  	I have participated at a social organization called western nerighbourhood house for over a year. There I have done a lot of 
  	charity fundraising events. For example, on Christmas, we did bake sale where we raised over $250. 
  	Also, we take orders from communities to produce customized t-shirts. <br /> Sometime, we will help organizing big events
  	such as Refugee Night where we helped with setting up the space, serving food and cleaning up.
